                    <h2>Bittersweet</h2>
                    <p>Rhubarb is an incredibly versatile plant (The jury is still out on whether rhubarb is a fruit or vegetable.) It makes an excellent choice to pair with sweet fruits like blood orange, apples or berries as well as other ingredients like vanilla, caramel, cinnamon, honey.  rhubarb can even be enjoyed on its own when mixed with a bit of sugar and if that is not enough, this plant can also be used in savory sauces, stews, salads and other savory dishes.</p>

                    <p class="quote-text">"sometimes a little bitterness could bring out the best in other flavors. Bitter rhubarb made sunny-day strawberry face the realities of life- and taste all the better for it."</p>

                    <h2>Strawberries BFF</h2>
                    <p>But I would be remiss to mention flavor pairings without talking about Rhubarb’s sexier, more popular BFF the strawberry! Yes, together these two make a formidable force in the culinary world delighting connoisseurs the world over with there decadent desserts such as their famous Crumble, or Pie and we mustn’t forget the classic English dish the strawberry rhubarb fool. </p>

                    <p class="quote-text">"If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life, it would be rhubarb fool, which I make with ginger and a hint of elderflower cordial."</p>
