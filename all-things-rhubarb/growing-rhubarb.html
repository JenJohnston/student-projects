                            <h2 class="care-h2">Growing Rhubarb, The Basics</h2>
                            <p>Rhubarb grows best in cold climates and is a cool seas perennial. After the growing season, rhubarb crowns become dormant and temperatures below 40°F (5°C) are required to stimulate bud break and allow for new growth. The growth of edible petioles and leaves emerges sequentially so as long as temperatures remain cool but As temperatures increase into the summer, top growth is suppressed then as temperatures decline late into the summer, foliage growth resumes.
                            </p>
                            <p>Alberta's climate along with the rest of Canada and the Northern United States is well suited to grow rhubarb, as a result you can expect to see high yields from your rhubarb crop.  
                            </p>
                            <p>While rhubarb can grow in most soils, it does best hen grown in fertile, well drained soils high in organic matter. Small perennial weeds may become a serious problem and should be killed the year before planting.  Rhubarb is relatively free of pest and disease problems</p>

                            <h2 class="care-h2">How to Fertilize</h2>
                            <p>Rhubarb grows best in slightly to moderately acidic soil though it is tolerant of higher acidity levels. Maximum yields can be attained with soils that are at a pH of 6.0 - 6.8 and large quantities of fertilizer are needed</p>
                            <p>The quality of the crop harvested largely depends on the care and fertilization received, for your home garden you should give each plant about 1 cup of 10-10-10 fertilizer each spring and should be applied in a circle when the plant growth starts.</p>
                            <p>You could also use manure which helps to conserve moisture, preserve soil structure and is high in nutrients.  One to two shovels per plant should be used for home gardeners and is beneficial in late fall or early winter but do not cover the crowns as it may encourage rotting.  Composted manure or leaves should be used as fresh manure will burn the rhubarb plants.</p>

                            <h2 class="care-h2">General Information</h2>
                            <p>Rhubarb roots needed to planted in the spring, seeds are ill advised as it would take too long for the plants to become established. Rhubarb should be spaced 60 - 120m apart and the roots with the crown bud 5cm below the surface of the soil.  Planting in raised beds helps ensure against the crowns rotting.</p>
